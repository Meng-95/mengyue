abstract: The coherent transmission technology using digital signal processing
  and advanced modulation formats, is bringing networks closer to the
  theoretical capacity limit of optical fibres, the Shannon limit. The
  in-phase/quadrature electro-optic modulator that encodes information on both
  the amplitude and the phase of light, is one of the underpinning devices for
  the coherent transmission technology. Ideally, such modulator should feature a
  low loss, low drive voltage, large bandwidth, low chirp and compact footprint.
  However, these requirements have been only met on separate occasions. Here, we
  demonstrate integrated thin-film lithium niobate in-phase/quadrature
  modulators that fulfil these requirements simultaneously. The presented
  devices exhibit greatly improved overall performance (half-wave voltage,
  bandwidth and optical loss) over traditional lithium niobate counterparts, and
  support modulation data rate up to 320 Gbit sâˆ’1. Our devices pave new routes
  for future high-speed, energy-efficient, and cost-effective communication
  networks.
