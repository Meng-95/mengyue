  Increasing data traffic and bandwidth-hungry applications require
  electro-optic modulators with ultra-wide modulation bandwidth for
  cost-efficient optical networks. Thus far, integrated solutions have emerged
  to provide high bandwidth and low energy consumption in compact sizes. Here,
  we review the design guidelines and delicate structures for higher bandwidth,
  applying them to lumped-element and traveling-wave electrodes. Additionally,
  we focus on candidate material platforms with the potential for ultra-wideband
  optical systems. By comparing the superiority and mechanism limitations of
  different integrated modulators, we design a future roadmap based on the
  recent advances.
