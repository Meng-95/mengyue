abstract: >-
  Thin-film lithium-niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) is a very attractive platform
  for optical interconnect and nonlinear optics. It is essential to enable
  lithium niobate photonic integrated circuits with low power consumption. Here
  we present an edge-coupling Mach–Zehnder modulator on the platform with low
  fiber-chip coupling loss of 0.5 dB/facet, half-wave voltage 𝑽𝝅 of 2.36 V,
  electro-optic (EO) bandwidth of 60 GHz and an efficient thermal-optic phase
  shifter with half-wave power of 6.24 mW. In addition, we experimentally
  demonstrate single-lane 200 Gbit/s data transmission utilizing a discrete
  multi-tone signal. The LNOI modulator demonstrated here shows great potential
  in energy-efficient large-capacity optical interconnects.
