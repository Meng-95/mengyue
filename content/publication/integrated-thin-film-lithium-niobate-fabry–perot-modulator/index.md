abstract: Integrated traveling-wave lithium niobate modulators need relatively
  large device lengths to achieve low drive voltage. To increase modulation
  efficiency within a compact footprint, we report an integrated
  Fabry–Perot-type electro-optic thin film lithium niobate on insulator
  modulator comprising a phase modulation region sandwiched between two
  distributed Bragg reflectors. The device exhibits low optical loss and a high
  tuning efficiency of 15.7 pm/V. We also confirm the modulator’s high-speed
  modulation performance by non-return-to-zero modulation with a data rate up to
  56 Gbit/s.
