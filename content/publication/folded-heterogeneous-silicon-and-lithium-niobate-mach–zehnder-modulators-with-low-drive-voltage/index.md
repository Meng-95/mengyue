  Optical modulators were, are, and will continue to be the underpinning devices
  for optical transceivers at all levels of the optical networks. Recently,
  heterogeneously integrated silicon and lithium niobate (Si/LN) optical
  modulators have demonstrated attractive overall performance in terms of
  optical loss, drive voltage, and modulation bandwidth. However, due to the
  moderate Pockels coefficient of lithium niobate, the device length of the
  Si/LN modulator is still relatively long for low-drive-voltage operation.
  Here, we report a folded Si/LN Mach–Zehnder modulator consisting of meandering
  optical waveguides and meandering microwave transmission lines, whose device
  length is approximately two-fifths of the unfolded counterpart while
  maintaining the overall performance. The present devices feature a low
  half-wave voltage of 1.24 V, support data rates up to 128 gigabits per second,
  and show a device length of less than 9 mm.
