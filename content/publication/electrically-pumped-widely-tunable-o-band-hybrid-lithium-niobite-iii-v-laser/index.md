  Significant improvements in the lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) platform
  are pushing LNOI-based laser sources to the forefront of integrated photonics.
  Here, we report the first, to the best of our knowledge, electrically pumped
  hybrid lithium niobate/III-V laser by butt coupling an InP-based optical gain
  chip with a LNOI photonic integrated circuit (PIC). In the PIC, a Vernier
  filter consisting of two LNOI microring resonators is employed to select the
  lasing wavelength. A wavelength tuning range of more than 36 nm is achieved in
  the O band. The hybrid laser has a maximum on-chip optical power of 2.5 mW and
  threshold current density of 2.5kA/cm2. A side mode suppression ratio better
  than 60 dB is achieved.
