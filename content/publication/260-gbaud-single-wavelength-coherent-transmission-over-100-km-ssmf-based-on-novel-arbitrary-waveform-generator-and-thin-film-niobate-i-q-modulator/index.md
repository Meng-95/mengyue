  In this paper, we demonstrate up to 260-GBaud single-wavelength coherent
  transmission by employing an optical transmitter based on two wide-bandwidth
  devices: a novel 260-GS/s arbitrary waveform generator with a 10-dB bandwidth
  of 90-GHz and a thin-film Lithium Niobate I/Q modulator with a 3-dB bandwidth
  of 110-GHz. We first assess the performance of our high symbol rate
  transmitter for generating spectrally efficient Nyquist multilevel modulation
  format signals at symbol rates up to 210-GBaud with >1.4-Tbps achievable
  information rates and by using linear digital signal processing only. We
  achieve up to 1.84-Tbps at 185-GBaud using PCS-64QAM, highlighting the linear
  behavior of our transmitter for high symbol rate Nyquist signaling. We then
  switch to dual-polarization QPSK coherent transmission and further increase
  the symbol rate up to 260-GBaud. Without using nonlinear
  digital-signal-processing nor advanced inter-symbol-interference mitigation
  techniques, we successfully transmit 260-GBaud QPSK at 800-Gbps net rate over
  100-km of standard single mode fiber.
