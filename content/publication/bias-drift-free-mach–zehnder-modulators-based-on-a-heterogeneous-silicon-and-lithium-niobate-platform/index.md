  Optical modulators have been and will continue to be essential devices for
  energy- and cost-efficient optical communication networks. Heterogeneous
  silicon and lithium niobate modulators have demonstrated promising
  performances of low optical loss, low drive voltage, and large modulation
  bandwidth. However, DC bias drift is a major drawback of optical modulators
  using lithium niobate as the active electro-optic material. Here, we
  demonstrate high-speed and bias-drift-free Mach–Zehnder modulators based on
  the heterogeneous silicon and lithium niobate platform. The devices combine
  stable thermo-optic DC biases in silicon and ultra-fast electro-optic
  modulation in lithium niobate, and exhibit a low insertion loss of 1.8 dB, a
  low half-wave voltage of 3 V, an electro-optic modulation bandwidth of at
  least 70 GHz, and modulation data rates up to 128 Gb/s.
