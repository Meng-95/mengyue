abstract: >-
  A tunable optical delay line (ODL) featuring high switching speed and low
  optical loss is highly desirable in many fields. Here, based on the thin-film
  lithium niobate platform, we demonstrate a digitally tunable on-chip ODL that
  includes five Mach-Zehnder interferometer optical switches, four flip-chip
  photodetectors, and four delay-line waveguides. The proposed optical switches
  can achieve a switching speed of 13 ns and an extinction ratio of 34.9 dB.
  Using a modified Euler-bend-based spiral structure, the proposed delay-line
  waveguide can simultaneously achieve a small footprint and low optical
  propagation loss. The proposed ODL can provide a maximum delay time of 150 ps
  with a resolution of 10 ps and feature a maximum insertion loss of 3.4 dB.
