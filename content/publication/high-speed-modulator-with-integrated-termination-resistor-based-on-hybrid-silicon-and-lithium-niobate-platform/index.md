  Hybrid Silicon and Lithium Niobate photonic integration platform has emerged
  as a promising candidate to combine the scalability of silicon photonic with
  the high modulation performance of Lithium Niobate. Here, we report a hybrid
  Silicon and Lithium Niobate Mach-Zehnder modulator integrated with a
  thermal-optical bias controller and an on-chip RF terminator. The device
  demonstrates high electro-optical bandwidth of up to 60GHz, low half-wave
  voltage of 2.25 V, and low optical on-chip loss of 2 dB, DC biasing half-wave
  voltage of 1.93 V (or biasing power of 23.77mW), with reliable and stable
  biasing characteristics. On-off keying modulation up to 100 Gbit/s and
  four-level pulse amplitude modulation up to 120 Gbit/s has been demonstrated
  with excellent performance. The scheme, with its low modulation voltage, low
  biasing power consumption, low optical insertion loss, large bandwidth, and
  its flexibility and simplicity of designing, packaging, and testing, can
  provide an excellent platform on which future high performance complex optical
  modulators can be developed.
