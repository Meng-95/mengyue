abstract: >-
  High-speed polarization management is highly desirable for many applications,
  such as remote sensing, telecommunication, and medical diagnosis. However,
  most of the approaches for polarization management rely on bulky optical
  components that are slow to respond, cumbersome to use, and sometimes with
  high drive voltages. Here, we overcome these limitations by harnessing
  photonic integrated circuits based on thin-film lithium niobate platform. We
  successfully realize a portfolio of thin-film lithium niobate devices for
  essential polarization management functionalities, including arbitrary
  polarization generation, fast polarization measurement, polarization
  scrambling, and automatic polarization control. The present devices feature
  ultra-fast control speeds, low drive voltages, low optical losses and compact
  footprints. Using these devices, we achieve high fidelity polarization
  generation with a polarization extinction ratio up to 41.9 dB and fast
  polarization scrambling with a scrambling rate up to 65 Mrad s−1, both of
  which are best results in integrated optics. We also demonstrate the endless
  polarization state tracking operation in our devices. The demonstrated devices
  unlock a drastically new level of performance and scales in polarization
  management devices, leading to a paradigm shift in polarization management.
