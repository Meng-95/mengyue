abstract: >-
  Hybrid Lithium Niobate (LN) and Silicon photonic (SiPh) integration platform
  has emerged as a promising candidate to combine the scalability of silicon
  photonics with the excellent modulation performance of LN. Mach-Zehnder
  modulators (MZMs) based on this platform exhibit outstanding performance with
  low insertion loss, low drive voltage, and large bandwidth. In this paper, we
  discuss the technologies for realizing hybrid LN/SiPh platform. The
  configuration and key metrics of LN/SiPh MZM are analyzed in detail.
  Furthermore, various functional devices derived from the Mach-Zehnder
  interferometer (MZI) configuration are also reviewed.
