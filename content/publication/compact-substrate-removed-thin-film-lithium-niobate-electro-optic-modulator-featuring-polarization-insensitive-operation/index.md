abstract: >-
  A compact polarization-insensitive electro-optic (EO) modulator, which allows
  the laser and modulator to be located at different locations while using a
  standard single-mode fiber to interconnect them, is highly desirable for 5G or
  future 6G wireless networks. Herein, we propose a modulator based on
  substrate-removed thin-film lithium niobate. The proposed device exhibits a
  polarization-dependent loss of 0.35 dB and on-chip loss of approximately 2 dB.
  The polarization insensitivity of the proposed device was experimentally
  demonstrated using a four-level pulse-amplitude modulation format at 50 Gbaud
  (100 Gb/ s).
