Throughout her Ph.D., Mengyue Xu concentrated her research on **thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN)** photonics and **heterogeneous Si/TFLN** photonics, particularly their applications in optical communication systems. She significantly contributed to the advancement of ultra-high-speed electro-optic **modulators** and efficient **optical frequency combs**, most notably the pioneering development of the first coherent modulator based on TFLN technology. Currently, she is engrossed in the exploration of quantum spin control of color centers in diamond and silicon carbide.
